  <h1>About IgniteUP</h1>

  <p>
    IgniteUP is a professional consulting firm focused on advising Micro,
    Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) across Haryana on government
    subsidies, financial structuring, risk management, and business visibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    We operate with a documentation-first, compliance-driven approach similar
    to established CA and legal advisory firms, ensuring that every engagement
    is handled with procedural accuracy, transparency, and accountability.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>

  <p>
    Effective consulting for MSMEs requires more than awareness of schemes or
    finance options. It requires a clear understanding of regulatory frameworks,
    attention to documentation, realistic eligibility assessment, and ethical
    advisory practices.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Experience</h2>

  <p>
    IgniteUP has advised and supported 20+ MSMEs across Haryana, facilitating
    more than ₹35 Crore in government subsidies through structured and
    compliant processes.
